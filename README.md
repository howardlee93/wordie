# Wordle Clone using React, Redux, Tailwind

[I wrote about the process of creating this clone]( https://howardlee93.medium.com/breaking-down-wordle-80d2a13f2390) as well as a little bit about reverse-engineering the [original game by Josh Wardle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

[Check out the demo!](https://howardlee93.github.io/wordie/)

To run this game locally:

```git
$> cd wordie
$> npm install
$> npm run start
```
